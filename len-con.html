                In this image we see a particle moving from one cloud to another. In a stationary reference frame, the distance would appear to be 2.01 kilometers. However, if the reference frame turned into a moving reference frame, the distance between the clouds and even the clouds themselves will appear to be shorter because of length contraction, making the distance between the clouds to appear to be 0.627 kilometers. Since the speed would be constant and the time would be dilated that means that the length would have to contract in order to make up for the difference.
