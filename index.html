                <p>
                    Special relativity is based on two laws. These two laws will be used throughout the entire explanation of this topic
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The speed of light in vacuum is always the same regardless of your reference point.</li>
                    <li>The laws of physics are identical in all inertial reference frames.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    With these laws now known we can proceed with the explanation of special relativity. The reason why special relativity is rarely used in everyday life is because it only applies to speeds that are a significant fraction to the speed of light or more. This is because as objects get closer and closer to the speed of light, factors such as mass, time, and distance start to behave differently to them, but what is important to remember is that they will never reach the speed of light.
