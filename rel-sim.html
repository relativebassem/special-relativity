                In these two videos we will see a rocket moving close to the speed of light as it passes by a sensor rigged to send a flash of light when the rocket passes by it. Let’s see when the light reaches the ends of the rocket with respect to the rocket and with respect to the sensor.

                    From the Sensor’s Reference frame
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Rocket’s Reference frame
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                As you can see in the frame of the rocket, the light reaches the edges at the same time. While in the frame of the sensor the light reaches the back of the rocket before it can reach the front. This is because in both cases the speed of light remained constant, the only difference was that in the sensors perspective the rocket was moving so the light had less distance to travel to get to the back, but in the rockets perspective it was stationary so the light had the same distance to the back and the front.
