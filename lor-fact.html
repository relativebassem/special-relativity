                Now to understand the relation between special relativity and Galilean relativity a Dutch physicist by the name of Hendrik Lorentz created the Lorentz Factor to complete the theory of special relativity.

                In the equation the Lorentz factor is represented by the Greek letter Gamma (γ) while the letter v represents the object’s speed in perspective to the stationary reference and c represents the speed of light constant. This expression appears in nearly all equations in special relativity. Such as in the equation of time dilation and length contraction.
