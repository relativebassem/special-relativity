                In the animation above light clocks are used that works by having a beam of light bouncing between two mirrors perpendicularly, where each time the light reflects off the mirror it counts as a period of time. The one that is stationary on earth only has the distance between the two mirrors to travel through. While the one on the rocket has to move the vertical distance of the mirrors and the horizontal distance of the rocketâ€™s velocity, making the path it has to pass through longer. Since the speed of light is a constant here and the distance is larger, then the time has to  increase in order to compensate for the extra distance using the
